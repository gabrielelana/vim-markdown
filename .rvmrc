# development environment upon cd'ing into the directory

# Only full ruby name is supported here, for short names use:
#     echo "rvm use 2.0.0" > .rvmrc

# rvmrc_rvm_version="1.23.14 (stable)" # 1.10.1 seems like a safe start

# file. This is very fast and efficient compared to running through the entire
# CLI and selector. If you want feedback on which environment was used then
# insert the word 'use' after --create as this triggers verbose mode.
